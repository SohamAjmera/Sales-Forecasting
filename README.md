# Sales Forecasting with Power BI Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on **sales forecasting** using machine learning techniques implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** and visualized using an advanced **Power BI dashboard**. The goal is to predict future sales trends based on historical data and provide business insights through interactive dashboards.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares sales data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements time series forecasting using models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTMs.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates accuracy using RMSE, MAE, and other key indicators.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Visualizes sales trends, predictions, and key performance indicators (KPIs) with a dynamic interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for data analysis and model training)
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, Prophet, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI** (for data visualization and dashboards)

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
cd sales-forecasting
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Open `SuperStoreSalesForecasting.ipynb` and execute the cells step by step.

### 4. Power BI Dashboard
- Load the dataset into Power BI.
- Connect it to the **forecasted sales output** from the Jupyter Notebook.
- Use **line charts, bar graphs, and KPIs** to visualize trends and insights dynamically.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Load and clean sales data.
2. **Train Forecasting Model:** Run the notebook to train and test the model.
3. **Export Forecast Results:** Save predictions and integrate them into Power BI.
4. **Analyze & Present:** Use the Power BI dashboard to interactively analyze sales trends.


## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) for better accuracy.
- Automate data integration between Jupyter and Power BI.
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
